# Exploring Trend in CO2 Emissions of Top 10 emitters Over 50 Years
The purpose of this project is to analyze trends in CO2 emissions over the last 50 years using Python. The project uses a dataset of greenhouse gas emissions from Our World in Data to describe how the emission levels of the current top 10 CO2 emitters have changed over the last 50 years. The analysis includes data preprocessing, filtering of top emitters, grouping of data by year and country, and plotting of time series graphs to visualize the trends.

The results of the analysis indicate that while the total CO2 emissions have increased globally, the top 10 emitters have had varying levels of emissions over the years. Some countries have had a steady increase, while others have had fluctuations and even a decline in emissions. 

Overall, this project provides insights into the changing patterns of CO2 emissions among the top 10 emitters over time, which can help inform discussions and policies related to climate change mitigation.
